# Back-End Development
Each team must have completed and [demo'd](https://knowledge.kitchen/content/courses/agile-development-and-devops/scrum/stakeholder-demos/) the working back-end of their group project by the end of the corresponding Sprint.

## Technical requirements

### Musts...

- All back-end code must be generated using **Express.js**.
- All dynamic routes must be completed and must respond with meaningful JSON data.
- All static routes must be completed and respond with the requested file.
- The front-end must be updated to make requests to the back-end for all data and functionality. The two must be completely integrated by the end of this sprint.
- Each developer must have written **unit tests** using the **mocha** and **chai** modules that provide at least 10% code coverage of the back-end code. Use the **istanbul nyc** module to verify code coverage.
- Instructions on how to set up and run the project must be included in the README.md file in version control. It must be possible for anybody to follow the instructions on the README.md to build and run the project on their local machines.

### Must nots...

- Back-end templating frameworks, such as Pug, Mustache, Handlebars, EJS, etc, are forbidden.
- Dynamic routes must not respond with React JSX, HTML, or anything but JSON data.
- Integration with a database must not be attempted yet.

### May...

- Any account registration or log in functionality may be begun during this sprint, but only if all other back-end tasks have been completed. It is okay to ignore account registration for this sprint and begin work on it in the next sprint.

## Grading

Individuals will be graded, in part, according to...

- individual code contributions, as visible through git logs - make sure you commit your own work!
- proper adherence to the [Feature Branch git workflow](https://knowledge.kitchen/content/courses/agile-development-and-devops/slides/feature-branch-workflow/)
- the [proper setup and maintenance of a GitHub repository](./instructions-0c-project-setup.md)
- the quality of the work
