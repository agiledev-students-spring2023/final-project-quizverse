Each team must collaboratively draft a CONTRIBUTING.md - a Markdown document exclusively dedicated to how others might contribute to this project. This document is essentially a contract agreed-upon by all developers and contributors, and includes at a minimum:

Details on the team's values and process:

the Team Norms
the Git workflow that the team follows
a detailed description of the rules of contributing and any considerations or how and what to contribute
instructions for setting up the local development environment in order to work on this project
instructions for building and testing the project (update with that information once the project reaches that stage)
This documents allows potential contributors, whether in the open source community or in a private organization, to see the project's rules and processes for contributions. It should be well-formatted with clear headings and subheadings.

GitHub provides a link to this document automatically to any user who creates a Pull Request on this project.
