# Prototyping

Create a clickable/tappable mobile prototype for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of your application. Use wireframe diagrams as the screens in the prototype.

## Software

Use [Figma's prototyping](https://www.figma.com/prototyping/) functionality to build the prototype - pick the mobile phone prototype option of your choosing.

## Prototype requirements

- all buttons, links or other user interface components that allow a user to transition from one screen to another must be functional in the prototype
- any user interface components that show a dynamic overlay panel when clicked or tapped must be functional in the prototype.
- you may need to create new variations of your existing wireframe diagrams in order to make the prototype look more "believable" - create as many as necessary to give a real sense of how the application flow might work.
- your prototypes must be designed to clearly show the way in which a user navigates from one screen to another, as well as how they solve the core use cases and needs your app is designed to solve.

## Publish files

Publish as follows:

1. Click the button to `Share` your prototype in Figma... this opens a panel where you can allow "`Anyone with the link`" to view it, and copy the link.
1. Update the `UX-DESIGN.md` document to include new section towards the top about the prototype, with a link to view the prototype online.
1. Use `git` to `add`, `commit`, and `push` your repository to GitHub.com.
